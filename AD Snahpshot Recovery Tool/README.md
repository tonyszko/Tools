# AD Snaphost Recovery Tool

Snapshot Recovery tool is command line interface tool which simplifies process of Active Directory deleted objects reanimation and populating these objects with data from Active Directory snapshot mounted in active instance.

This tool can be also used to populate existing (not deleted) object with data from Active Directory snapshot without performing actual un-delete operation. This functionality makes this tool perfect choice for performing quick AD object recovery to state from given point in time. In opposite to other recovery methods like using CSV or LDIF data export from snapshot this tool allows to complete whole operation in single command for multiple objects.

You can read more about AD snapshots and how to work with them in Daniel's Petri excelent article: [Working with Active Directory Snapshots in Windows Server 2008](https://petri.com/working-active-directory-snapshots-windows-server-2008).
